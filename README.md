# Othello-AI
This project creates an AI that plays Othello. It uses the Minimax algorithm, with Alpha-Beta Pruning.

The way this program works is as follows: When you run the program, you must enter in a size for the game board (NOTE: MUST BE EVEN SIZE. OTHELLO CANNOT HAVE AN ODD BOARD SIZE). Then my AI will play against another bot that makes random moves. I have a Player v.s. Bot version as well, and might upload it. 

This AI placed 2nd in the class tournament held. It lost to the first place AI because I have not yet implemented a time control for it.
